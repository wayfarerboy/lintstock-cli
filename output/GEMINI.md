This directory is for all generated output. You can write files here, including new reports, charts, and helper scripts.

When writing any text-based files, such as reports or summaries, please adhere to the following guidelines:

-   **File Format:** Save the files with a `.md` extension to ensure they are rendered correctly as Markdown.
-   **Styling:** Use Markdown formatting (e.g., headings, bold text, lists, tables) to structure the content and improve readability where appropriate.

When generating charts with Chart.js, please ensure the output HTML file includes a section with the Chart.js configuration code wrapped in `<pre>` tags. This will make it easy for the user to inspect and copy the code.
