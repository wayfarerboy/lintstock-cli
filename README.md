# Lintstock CLI

This tool allows you to ask questions about the board review reports.

## What it Does

After running the `npm run gemini` command, you can interact with the tool by asking it questions in plain English. It will analyze the reports located in the `reports/` directory to provide you with answers.

You can also ask it to:
*   **Generate new files:** Create new reports, summaries, or charts based on the data.
*   **Adopt a writing style:** Instruct it to mimic the writing style of a document from the `styles/` directory for any generated text.

To provide the most accurate answers, the tool may sometimes create its own helper scripts to process the data.

All generated content, including new reports, charts, and helper scripts, will be saved in the `output/` directory.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this tool, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. Node.js is a program that allows you to run the scripts in this project.

1.  **Install Node.js**:
    *   Visit the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
    *   Download the **LTS** (Long Term Support) version recommended for most users.
    *   Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

2.  **Set Up Your API Key**:
    *   This tool uses the Gemini API to understand and process your questions. You will need to provide your own API key to use it.
    *   Create a new file in the main project folder called `.env`.
    *   Open the `.env` file and add the following line, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
        ```
    *   You can generate a new API key from Google AI Studio: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

## Instructions

Follow these steps to prepare your data and run the report analysis:

1.  **Open a Terminal:**
    *   On your Mac, find the project folder (`lintstock-cli`).
    *   Right-click on the folder.
    *   Select **New Terminal at Folder** from the menu. This will open a new terminal window that is already in the correct directory.

2.  **Install Project Dependencies:**
    *   In the terminal window you just opened, type the following command and press **Enter**:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   This will download and install all the necessary components for the project. You only need to do this once.

3.  **Prepare Your Data:**
    *   Locate the `data` folder within the `lintstock-cli` project folder.
    *   Place all of your Excel report files inside this `data` directory.
    *   In your terminal window, run the data preparation script by typing the following command and pressing **Enter**:
        ```bash
        npm run prepare
        ```
    *   This command will convert your Excel files into a format the tool can understand and place them in the `reports` directory.

4.  **Run the Analysis:**
    *   Once the data preparation is complete, you can start the analysis tool.
    *   In the same terminal window, type the following command and press **Enter**:
        ```bash
        npm run gemini
        ```
    *   This will start the interactive session where you can ask questions about the reports.

You are now ready to interrogate the reports.

## Directory Structure

*   `data/`: This is where you should place your report Excel files.
*   `output/`: This directory is for files generated by Gemini, such as data analysis, new reports, charts, and other helper scripts.
*   `reports/`: This directory contains the processed JSON versions of your Excel files, which are used for the analysis.
*   `scripts/`: This directory holds helper scripts for the project.
*   `styles/`: Place documents in this directory that you want to use as a writing style reference for generated content. For best results, use plain text files (.txt or .md), as this makes it easier for Gemini to read and adopt the writing style.
